Welcome to OCaMOSS!!
Commands (case-sensitive): 

run [threshold] --- runs oCaMoss on the working directory.
The threshold argument gives the program the percentage of the file to match
with another for it to be flagged as plagiarised. It is optional with default
value 0.5, and must be at least 0.4 and at most 1
dir --- lists the working directory and the files that it contains
setdir [dir] --- sets the directory to look for files and resets any results
results --- lists the file names for which there are results
results [filename] --- lists the detailed results of overlap for that file
resultpairs -- lists all the pairs of files for which there are results
compare [fileA] [fileB] --- prints out specific overlaps of files A and B
quit --- exits the REPL
help --- display instructions again
> Successfully set working directory to: mock_input/student_submissions
Files: 
A_1.py
